vector elements:
x1=10, x2=20
y1=40, y2=50

 point we want to interpolate:
P=(x=14,y=48)

 The interpolated value of the function at R1=(x,y1) is 1.74
The interpolated value of the function at R2=(x,y2) is 3.78

The interpolated value of the function at (x=14, y=48) is equal to 3.372


 change values of x_i,x_j and y_i,y_j in x_i_y_i.txt file as well as interpolated point in the third line

 change matrix values F_ij in F_ijVals.txt
